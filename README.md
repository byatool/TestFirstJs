TestFirstJs
===========

This is an example of how to do test first.

This should be fairly language agnostic, but I used Javascript since it requires a text editor, and a browser.  Just in case you didn't know, if you're resding this you have at least 50% of the needed tools.  Unless you are reading this with your mind.  Then you may have 0% of what's needed.  However, if you are reading this with only your mind;  You probably ended up here by mistake anyhow... Kind of like everyone else.

All the needed files are here including a step by step photo transmogrograph exchanger.


Jasmine can be found here:

Though all its files are in this repository.
